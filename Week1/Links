Some general notes :

pinMode( ) to set whether input or output -> for devices like switch/button where u need to read the state of it, give it as input
                                           -> for devices like motor, led, sensors, etc you need to give it as output
                                           
                                           
digitalRead() and digitalWrite() -> digital stands for either 0 or 1, i.e low or high

digitalRead(of a pin) gives either high or low

digitalWrite(of a pin, high or low) can be used to set the high or low values

eg -> led, needs high to glow, low to stop

analogRead(of a pin) and analogWrite(pin, value)

for analogRead() -> a value between 0 to 1023 will be read, it can be converted to a corresponding value out of 5 volts
- The value of sensors etc are read, so it needs input configuration


for analogWrite() -> use the pwm pins to generate an analog output given by the analogWrite() pins 3,5,6,9,11

duty cycle -> ontime / (ontime / offtime) -> that is how the digital is converted to analog outputs

this is used to drive motors, change the intensity of bulbs, or the multicolored LED
